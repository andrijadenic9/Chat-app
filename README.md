# Chat App

Welcome to the Chat App repository! This application offers a secure platform for two users to engage in conversations. It is built using JavaScript for real-time interactions, along with HTML and CSS to create an intuitive user interface.

## Features

- **Two-User Chat**:
  - Seamlessly communicate with another user in a private chat environment.

- **Message Censorship**:
  - The app includes a word filter to maintain a respectful atmosphere.
  - Messages containing restricted words (e.g., "pizza," "bread," "monster") will be automatically censored.
